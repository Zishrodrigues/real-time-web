## Week 1: Sockets.io playground & testing

During the first week of Real-Time-Web I focused on getting to know the basics of Sockets.io and understanding it's inner workings.
To accomplish this I created a simple chat app which demonstrated the foundations of using Sockets by creating an open channel between the client and client.

### Wishlist / to-do
- [x] Create active Socket connection

### Installing locally

Using the following steps you can install and use the app locally.

#### Cloning or downloading the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Zishrodrigues/real-time-web.git
```
#### Installing the required dependencies
Go into the folder week-1 and run the following command:
```
$ npm install
```
Wait for the required npm packages to install and proceed further.

#### Starting and running the server
Make sure port 3007 isn't being used by another project. If this is the case run the following command in the root of your project
```
$ npm run start
```
If you get the message ```app listening in port 3007 ``` the server started successfully on localhost:3007.
